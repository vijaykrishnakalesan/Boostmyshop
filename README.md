### Coding Challenge Guidelines

Please reproduce this landing page using Tailwindcss and NextJS.

Here is a few hint:
- Setup a project https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs
- Try to find a way to extract the asset you need from the png or find the closest alternative.
- You donâ€™t need to do the two dropdown menu (Solutions and More)
- Split the landing into relevant react components.
- It should work on mobile too!

Good luck!
